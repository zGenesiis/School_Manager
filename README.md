I am studying PHP in an online college called Alura,
and to test and train what I learned, I made this repository:
a personal project called Classmanager, where ypu can control
the good and bad grades, abscences, make arrays and much more.
Remember, IM LEARNING, so all these features will be added by time.
If you have any suggestion, please tell me.
