# School Manager: A way to organize and control your school data

##  Introduction

This a study project that I am working on for while to 
pratice my OOP knoweldge that I got from Alura,
a brazillian online school.
Go comment what you think that can be optimized, maybe I will don't
understand on the first time but I will try to apply whatever new skill I have got.


## Technologies

For now, only PHP is being used, but you can see an html file because
I am planning to make this a website. were you can play with all of the features using
a good interface. Depending on the time I will take to learn, SQL may be included too.


## HIW - How It Works

Here you will see what you can do with this code:
> _Disclaimer: (English version of the code will be lauched in fututre commits)._
> _In case you just want to see it working, You can use the [default data]()._

First of all, you need to create at least a [school](./School), a [grade](./Grade), a [teacher](./Teacher) and a [student](./Student)
to start.

All starts with the teacher making tests, that are automatically stored on the class object.
But remember: It is the test mould. To some student answer, a require is made and a copy of the test is sent
to the student, who can answer, store this test with him and send it back to the teacher.

After the teacher takes the test, it can be revised and automatically sent to the "revised tests of the class" storage.

> From down here, all the features described are not on the code yet.

When send to this storage, all of them are linked to the school tests storage, were the teachers can
filter tests by good or bad notes, by class, by students and by theme.


If you see everything that can be optimezed, please tell me.

Thanks for reading.
